Actually should have written a note about this a long time ago. Anyway, it's better now than never.

#Jackson

[Jackson docs](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs)

Jackson is the json parsing lib I'm using at work, mainly used for converting json stored in DB and DTO used in code back and forth. 
They also listed some helpful tutorial in the doc website. So far I'm just learning bit by bit whenever I encounter some issues, I'll learn
this systematically with the tutorial and continueously update this note.
